# Speeding up NMT models
This Github Repository belongs to my Master Thesis: Speeding up inference time of Neural Machine Translation.
It consist of two parts:
* nmt_experiments -  base for all experiments done in the thesis for replication of obtained results
* demo_app - implementation of the demo application exposing all trained models
